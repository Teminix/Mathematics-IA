# Mathematics-IA
Here is the repository for my mathematics IA data collection. Please read this to understand what purpose each file serves. 

### `main.html`

----

This is an html file which I had used to test out some JavaScript code, it is purely a testing environment and doesn't serve any other purpose

### `Main.ipynb`

----

This is the main Jupyter notebook where I collect the data.

### `Radix trees.ipynb`

----

This is the jupyter notebook where I test out the Radix tree concept which will assist me in expanding terms using python

### `trees.py` 

----

This is the extended radix trees library which I have coded to assist in my math IA.
